# cancer-prediction-model
This project implements a logistic regression model to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on medical imaging data. The analysis is part of a university assignment.

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, accessible via sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer(). It contains 30 numerical features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.

Target values:

0: Malignant

1: Benign

Features include:

Mean values (e.g., mean radius, mean texture)

Worst-case values (e.g., worst area, worst smoothness)

Standard errors (e.g., radius error, texture error)
